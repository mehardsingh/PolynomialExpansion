# Polynomial Expansion
A deep learning solution using Transformers to expand complex factored polynomials. 

Run cells in `descriptive_stats.ipynb` to evaluate frequency of tokens and vocabulary for dataset `data.txt`.

Run cells in `generate_models.ipynb` to generate and save Transformer model for polynomial expansion.
